The code to generate the results for the Criteo experiment in the
paper can currently be found in the following repositories:

https://github.com/rgiordan/LinearResponseVariationalBayes.py/tree/master/Models/LogisticGLMM
https://github.com/rgiordan/criteo
https://github.com/rgiordan/StanSensitivity
https://github.com/rgiordan/LRVBUtils

I will be gradually making the process of re-running the experiments more
user-friendly.  In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me for
assistance as necessary.

To begin, you may cross your fingers attempt to run `make` in the current
directory.

##############

To create a virtual environment and install the package, create an empyt directory ``venv`` and run

~~~
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=criteo_experiment_jmlr1951
~~~

To delete this kernel when you are through, you can run ``jupyter kernelspec list`` and delete the directory corresponding to the ``bnpgmm_runjingdev`` kernel.

You must additionally manually install
[``scikit-sparse``](https://github.com/scikit-sparse/scikit-sparse/),
which requires the C++ libraries in ``libsuitesparse-dev``.
See the
[``scikit-sparse`` requirements](https://scikit-sparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#requirements)
for more details on installation.
