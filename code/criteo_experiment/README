The code to generate the results for the Criteo experiment in the
paper can currently be found in the following repositories:

https://github.com/rgiordan/LinearResponseVariationalBayes.py/tree/master/Models/LogisticGLMM
https://github.com/rgiordan/criteo
https://github.com/rgiordan/StanSensitivity
https://github.com/rgiordan/LRVBUtils

I will be gradually making the process of re-running the experiments more
user-friendly.  In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me for
assistance as necessary.

To begin, you may cross your fingers attempt to run `make` in the current
directory.
