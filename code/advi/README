Reproducing the ADVI results will be a little trickier than the other
experiments because they rely on a custom branch of Stan and rstan.
Eventually these changes will hopefully be incorporated into trunk,
but in the meantime one must do a custom install.

You'll need to check out and install the `add_hessian4` branch of
my fork of `rstan`:
https://github.com/rgiordan/rstan/tree/add_hessian4

...and the `add_hessians2` branch of my fork of `stan`:
https://github.com/rgiordan/stan/tree/add_hessians2

Once these are installed, you should be able to run `advi_base.R`
to generate the results.
